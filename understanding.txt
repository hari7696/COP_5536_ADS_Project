To accurately manage the order delivery system as per the given scenario, here are the detailed steps, incorporating the understanding of order creation, ETA calculation, priority determination, and the impact of order updates:

### 1. Order Creation (`createOrder`)
   - **Calculate Priority**: For each new order, calculate its priority based on the formula `priority = 0.3 * (orderValue / 50) - 0.7 * currentSystemTime`.
   - **Determine ETA**:
     - For the first order, ETA is simply `currentSystemTime + deliveryTime`.
     - For subsequent orders, ETA is calculated based on the return time of the previous order (which is its ETA plus its delivery time) and the delivery time of the current order.
   - **Store Orders**: Insert the order into two AVL trees, one sorted by priority and the other by ETA.

### 2. ETA Calculation
   - ETA for each order is determined at the time of creation, considering the time it would take for the delivery person to return to the source and then deliver the new order.
   - The ETA of a newly created order is the max of the current system time or the time the driver would be back from the last delivery, plus the delivery time of the new order.

### 3. Updating Order (`updateTime`)
   - When an order's delivery time is updated, its new ETA is recalculated.
   - This recalculated ETA can affect subsequent orders’ ETAs, so it’s necessary to update all affected orders.
   - The updated ETA is based on the updated delivery time and the sequence of deliveries as determined by the priorities and existing ETAs.

### 4. Prioritizing Orders
   - Orders are prioritized for delivery based on their calculated priority. The order with the highest priority should be delivered first.
   - If an order's delivery time is updated, it may affect its delivery sequence based on its new priority relative to other orders.

### 5. Delivering Orders (`deliver_orders`)
   - Orders are delivered as per their ETA. If the current system time is equal to or greater than an order’s ETA, that order is delivered.
   - When an order is delivered, it’s removed from both AVL trees, and the ETAs for remaining orders are checked to ensure they are still accurate.

### 6. Handling Order Cancellation (`cancelOrder`)
   - If an order is canceled, it needs to be removed from the AVL trees.
   - Canceling an order may affect the ETAs of subsequent orders, especially if the canceled order was scheduled to be delivered before them.

### 7. Printing Orders
   - Orders within a specified time range can be printed to check which orders are scheduled for delivery in that window.

### 8. System Time and Order Delivery
   - The system keeps track of the time through `currentSystemTime`. This time is considered for calculating ETAs and prioritizing orders.

### 9. Quitting the System (`Quit`)
   - The system terminates its operation and no further orders are processed after the `Quit` command.

By carefully managing the order insertion, prioritization, delivery, and update processes, the system can accurately schedule and deliver orders based on their priorities and required delivery times, ensuring efficient logistics operations.
