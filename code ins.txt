System Overview
The system manages the delivery of orders using one delivery driver. It prioritizes orders based on a formula and schedules deliveries based on the Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) and priority. The system uses two AVL trees to store orders: one sorted by priority and the other by ETA.

Order Creation (createOrder)
Input Parameters: Order ID, current system time, order value, delivery time.
Priority Calculation: Use the formula priority = 0.3 * (orderValue / 50) - 0.7 * currentSystemTime to calculate the priority of the order.
ETA Calculation:
For the first order, ETA is currentSystemTime + deliveryTime.
For subsequent orders, calculate the ETA based on the return time of the driver from the previous delivery and the delivery time of the current order. Use the formula ETA = max(currentSystemTime, (ETA of previous order + delivery time of previous order)) + delivery time of current order.
Insertion into AVL Trees: Insert the order into two AVL trees, one sorted by priority and the other by ETA.
ETA Calculation
The ETA for each order is determined at the time of creation, considering the time it would take for the delivery person to return to the source and then deliver the new order.
The ETA of a newly created order is the maximum of the current system time or the time the driver would be back from the last delivery, plus the delivery time of the new order.
Updating Order (updateTime)
Input Parameters: Order ID, new delivery time.
Recalculate ETA: Update the delivery time of the order and recalculate its ETA based on the updated delivery time and the sequence of deliveries as determined by the priorities and existing ETAs.
Update AVL Trees: Update the positions of the order in the AVL trees based on the new ETA and priority.
Prioritizing Orders
Orders are prioritized for delivery based on their calculated priority. The order with the highest priority should be delivered first.
If an order's delivery time is updated, it may affect its delivery sequence based on its new priority relative to other orders.
Delivering Orders (deliver_orders)
Orders are delivered as per their ETA. If the current system time is equal to or greater than an order’s ETA, that order is delivered.
When an order is delivered, it’s removed from both AVL trees, and the ETAs for remaining orders are checked to ensure they are still accurate.
Handling Order Cancellation (cancelOrder)
Input Parameters: Order ID, cancellation time.
Remove Order: Remove the order from the AVL trees.
Update ETAs: Canceling an order may affect the ETAs of subsequent orders, especially if the canceled order was scheduled to be delivered before them. Recalculate the ETAs for affected orders.
Printing Orders
Orders within a specified time range can be printed to check which orders are scheduled for delivery in that window. This can be done by traversing the AVL tree sorted by ETA and printing orders whose ETAs fall within the specified range.
System Time and Order Delivery
The system keeps track of the time through currentSystemTime. This time is considered for calculating ETAs and prioritizing orders.
Quitting the System (Quit)
The system terminates its operation, and no further orders are processed after the Quit command.
By carefully managing the order insertion, prioritization, delivery, and update processes, the system can accurately schedule and deliver orders based on their priorities and required delivery times, ensuring efficient logistics operations.
